Nothing is impossible. The word itself says "I'm possible!" 

You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.

Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving. 

It isn't where you came from. It's where you're going that counts. 

If I cannot do great things, I can do small things in a great way. 

The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today.

Change your thoughts and you change your world.
